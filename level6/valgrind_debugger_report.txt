=== Valgrind-GDB Integration Report ===
=================================

Program Analysis Details:
1. Memory Error Detection:
   - Line 15: Use of uninitialized variable 'string_so_far'
   - Location: if(string_so_far != (char *)0)
   - Impact: Could cause unpredictable behavior

2. Memory Leaks Found:
   - Leak of 'string' buffer allocated at Line 12
   - No corresponding free() call found
   - Size: variable based on input arguments

3. Segmentation Fault Analysis:
   - Occurred at strcat(string, argv[i])
   - Caused by invalid memory access
   - Related to uninitialized string_so_far

4. Debugging Session Details:
   - Successfully attached GDB to Valgrind process
   - Breakpoint hit at main() function
   - Step-by-step execution revealed:
     * string_so_far used before initialization
     * memory allocated but never freed
     * program crashes on invalid memory access

5. Valgrind-GDB Integration Commands Used:
   valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./hello
   gdb ./hello
   (gdb) target remote | vgdb
   (gdb) break main
   (gdb) continue
   (gdb) next
   (gdb) print string_so_far
   (gdb) print string
   (gdb) print length

6. Conclusion:
   Successfully demonstrated integration between Valgrind and GDB
   Identified multiple memory-related issues in the code
   Showed exact locations and nature of the problems
