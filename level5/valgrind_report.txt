Valgrind Report for hello.cpp:

1. **Uninitialized Value Usage:**
   - Location: Line 15 (`if(string_so_far != (char *)0)`)
   - Cause: Variable `string_so_far` is not initialized before being used.
   - Effect: Conditional jump based on uninitialized value.

2. **Invalid Memory Read:**
   - Location: Line 18 (`strcat(string, argv[i]);`)
   - Cause: Variable `string` is not properly initialized as an empty string (`\0`).
   - Effect: Invalid memory read leads to segmentation fault.

3. **Segmentation Fault:**
   - Location: Line 18 (`strcat(string, argv[i]);`)
   - Cause: Uninitialized or improperly allocated memory is used with `strcat`.
   - Effect: Program crashes due to invalid memory access.

4. **Heap Usage:**
   - In Use at Exit: 72,728 bytes in 2 blocks.
   - Cause: Allocated memory is not freed using `free`.
   - Effect: Memory remains "still reachable" but not released to the system.

Conclusion:
The program contains multiple issues related to uninitialized variables, improper memory management, and lack of memory deallocation.
